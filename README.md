# destruction-2d-unity
Highly optimized 2D Destruction engine in Unity. Utilizes multiple CPU threads to do shape detection, and then uses multiple GPU threads to detect polygon holes, generate colliders, run fracture patterns, and manage sprites. Capable of optimally running and destroying multiple sprites of even 1000x1000 sizes.

The engine is able to deal with a number of complex shapes as well as destruction patterns, such as this one below, where a tree is stamped.
