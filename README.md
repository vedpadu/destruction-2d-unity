# destruction-2d-unity
Highly optimized 2D Destruction engine in Unity. Utilizes multiple CPU threads to do shape detection, and then uses multiple GPU threads to detect polygon holes, generate colliders, run fracture patterns, and manage sprites. Capable of optimally running and destroying multiple sprites of even 1000x1000 sizes.
